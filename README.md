# Queertone
## What is Queertone?

The project is about allowing to port python modules - and pytorch models in particular - into puredata.

The name comes from the fact that puredata is also called pd which is french for "fag". Be reassured, the author of this repo is a bi trans man ! Anyhow, Queertone is simply a pun between puredata and python.
